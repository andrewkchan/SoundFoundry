# SoundFoundry

## Introduction

SoundFoundry is a barebones remake of the SoundCloud.com frontend using React and Redux. It features an infinitely scrollable track list drawn from SoundCloud and a fully featured streaming music player.

## Installation and Quick Start

1. `cd client`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start` to start a development server at localhost:8080. `npm run build` to build a production module at client/public/js/main.js.
