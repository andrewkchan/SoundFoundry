# SoundFoundry

## Introduction

SoundFoundry is a barebones remake of the SoundCloud.com frontend using React and Redux. It features an infinitely scrollable track list drawn from SoundCloud and a fully featured streaming music player.

## Installation and Quick Start

1. `cd client`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start` to start a development server at localhost:8080. `npm run build` to build a production module at client/public/js/main.js.

## Credits

Heavily influenced by Andrew Ngu's [Sound-Redux project](https://github.com/andrewngu/sound-redux).

SoundFoundry also makes use of the following libraries:

* [Normalizr](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr)
* [SoundCloud JavaScript API](https://github.com/soundcloud/soundcloud-javascript)
* [Redux Thunk Middleware](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)
* [react-chartjs-2](https://github.com/gor181/react-chartjs-2), a React wrapper for [ChartJS](http://www.chartjs.org/)
